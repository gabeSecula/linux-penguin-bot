# linux-penguin-bot

This is a bot that reads messages from Discord, executes them in a linux bash, and returns output as a message on Discord. Currently the bot executes commands on the terminal it is run from, making it outlandishly unsafe and unsuitable for public Discord server use. If you want to take the bot and use it with your own token go ahead.
