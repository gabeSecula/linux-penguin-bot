# linux-penguin-bot

This is a bot that reads messages from Discord, execute them in a linux bash, and return the output as a message. Currently the bot executes commands on the terminal it is run from, making it outlandishly unsafe and unsuitable for public server use. If you want to take the bot and use it with your own token go ahead.
